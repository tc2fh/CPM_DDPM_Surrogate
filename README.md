This repo contains the code for the paper:
# Generative diffusion model surrogates for mechanistic agent-based biological models

This repo contains a fork of NVIDIA's EDM2 forked October 5, 2024. We make minor modifications to the NVIDIA EDM2 code to allow for tensorboard logging as well as support for single channel images which is appropriate for our use case as a surrogate model that generates Cellular-Potts agent-based model configurations. 


We use CompuCell3D 4.6.0 for generating training data
- [CompuCell3D](https://compucell3d.org/)


# Additional folders:
 - CC3D_Mechanistic_Model: Code used to generate training data to train the DDPM surrogate model
 - classify_generated_images: code to use a trained classifier to classify the images generated by a trained DDPM surrogate trained using the EDM2 recipe
 - Image_classifier_training: code used to train an image classifier for use as described in the paper.
